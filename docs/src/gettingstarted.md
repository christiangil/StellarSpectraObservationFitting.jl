## Getting Help

To get help on specific functionality you can either look up the
information here, or if you prefer you can make use of Julia's
native doc-system. For example here's how to get
additional information on [`StellarSpectraObservationFitting.calculate_initial_model`](@ref) within Julia's REPL:

```julia
?StellarSpectraObservationFitting.calculate_initial_model
```

If you encounter a bug or would like to participate in the
development of this package come find us on Github.
