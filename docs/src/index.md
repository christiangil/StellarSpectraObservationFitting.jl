# StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl Documentation

StellarSpectraObservationFitting (SSOF) is a Julia package for creating data-driven models (with fast, physically-motivated Gaussian Process regularization) for the time-variable spectral features for both the telluric transmission and stellar spectrum measured by Extremely Precise Radial Velcotiy (EPRV) spectrographs. 

## Where to begin?
